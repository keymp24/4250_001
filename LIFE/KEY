On a weekly basis, pursue additional opportunites outside of classroom to further educated myself on the topics taught in class. 
This looks like watching Youtube videos covering topics taught in class and reading articles that elaborate on these topics.

Take time to read class material thoroughly well in advance before class covering each topic. This will provide me with
foresight into topics we will cover later on, thus increasing understanding of how topics taught are tied together. It 
also will provide additional preporation time for any opportunites for exceeeding expectations (coming up with a 5 min presentation
in advance of the morning before.)

During class time, I will be engaged and attentive to watch for opportunities that I can exceed expectations. 

Outside of class, I will look for opportunites to apply the topics learned in this class to problems I face in other classes or 
at my job. 

In all situations, apply myself fully when faced with adversity. The way this looks like for this class is when faced with a 
difficult problem or when having trouble finding ways to exceed expectations, that I invest the time and effort to come up with
not only a correct solution, but one that requires me to put forth an honest effort. This results in increased internalization
of topics learned and provides repetition for going above requirements.
