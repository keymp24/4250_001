Life is like a waterfall project. There is a big bang release at the end with no ability to do upgrades or updates (depending on your philosophy).

Referring back to the Jobs presentation…
Using the skills from Problem Solving presentation…
Tied into feedback from Persusasive Essay…
Generate a project plan for yourself that culminates into a “big bang” release at the end of the semester (leveraging lessons from Project Management and Waterfall)...

On your computer, open a text file and title it “My Goals”.

Write down your Life goal(s). 
  Like a project goal.
Write down your 5 year goal(s). 
  Like a project’s major milestones.
What do you need to do in the next 12 months to achieve the 5 year goal? 
  Like a high level project plan (before task definitions)
What do you need to do in the next 90 days (this semester) to achieve your 1 year goal? 
  Like a detailed project plan.
This should include ways you (specifically, personally, and uniquely) will exceed expectations in this class the rest of the semester (do not include the two examples I gave you; doing well on quizzes and reading optional material; you should be well past this stage of performance).
  Add this last part to your status report this week.

—-----------------
 When you are done, save this somewhere for yourself and MAKE IT HAPPEN.
